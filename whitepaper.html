                <p>The whitepaper in front of you represents an effort by Pcore team to establish a trustworthy
                    marketplace for companies to buy, sell, and maintain invoice-related investments. The online
                    platform uses blockchain technology to power up all transactions, ensures security, all the while
                    providing necessary privacy for organizations. <br>
                    Due to the issues that mainstream markets face when invoice factoring is in question, we plan to
                    implement Hive and smart contract systems that build up transparent blockchain ledger records.
                    Through blockchain, we aim to create a safe haven for both invoice sellers and investors. We also
                    provide “cover” services, which will secure funds of both sellers and buyers within our platform.
                    <br>
                    The Hive, Altman Z-score, smart contracts, and other technological components serve as tools for
                    identity verification, upholding highest security standards in the industry. Thus, we aim to
                    scrutinize all companies involved before transactions even take place within our online platform.
                    <br>
                    The invoice processing takes up measurements or risk factoring, interest gained for investors, and
                    even pool investment. The main currency of trade within the platform shall be Pcore token, tradable
                    for any other fiat currency in the market. Additionally, we plan to establish partnership deals
                    with major crypto exchanges to smooth out transactions outside the Pcore platform. <br>
                    In order to build up an online marketplace, we intend to release an ICO that would allow us to
                    build up necessary operations, hire professionals, and set up support office within the UK. The
                    total supply stands at 52 million Pcore tokens, including 20 million designated for the crypto
                    crowdfunding.

                <h1 id="list-item-2"><span class="yellow-border">In</span>troduction</h1>
                <p>The world of business was and shall remain quite complex, what with technological advancement.
                    Operational processes develop at an unprecedented rate, involving even more chess pieces than ever
                    before. Competition is fierce while customers are demanding quality and attractive price programs.
                    These programs rely on invoice financing more than ever before, to attract a larger number of
                    potential customers. <br>
                    Invoice financing (A/R), as a term, is nothing new in the business world, as it allows steady
                    revenue flow for companies. It is a form of a contract between buyer and seller, where the customer
                    has an option of paying for goods at later date. Usually, 30, 60, or 90-day notice provides the
                    buyer a chance to pick up the chosen goods or services while the company enjoys stabilized income
                    over a period of time. However, once the deal is made, the business in question also suffers in
                    terms of liquidity, as it can only collect the debt at later date. <br>
                    At the same time, the emergence of blockchain technology came with rising interest from
                    organizations all over the globe. Decentralized networks, globalized cryptocurrencies, and smart
                    contracts all have their own role to play. However, probably the most distinguished feature that
                    blockchain offers is the security of transfers. The system itself, through smart contracts, has the
                    ability to improve the integrity of transactions, guaranteeing that all parties should act on their
                    promises for transfer to take place. <br>
                    Hence, we at Pcore Ltd. offer a market that can significantly improve the liquidity of our business
                    customers. Through the blockchain network, developed by our team, we offer a marketplace where
                    receivable invoices can be sold securely. The platform enables businesses to connect, upload, and
                    trade invoices, improving the liquidity rate of companies while providing a good investment ground
                    for companies that seek safe funding projects. <br>
                    Both sides have numerous advantages to speak of when trading invoices at the Pcore platform.
                    Companies selling them would increase their immediate funding capabilities, needed to buy
                    materials, pay for the production of goods, or even to pay their employees’ salaries. Buyers
                    (lenders henceforth), on the other hand, can earn profit from the credible commercial business.
                    Through finance of receivables, lenders earn interest as a profit. The most important criteria to
                    meet is thus trustworthiness of partners, making the factoring the perfect solution. <br>
                    The entire marketplace is powered-up by blockchain technology, including smart contracts that
                    provide a safe environment for both invoice buyers and sellers. We also offer a token called
                    [nameoftoken] as a medium of payment, where its value is pegged to British Pound (GBP) on 1:1
                    basis. <br>
                    With the global market in mind, we plan to offer a secure platform where lenders and businesses can
                    meet and conduct transactions using our blockchain-based services. The Whitepaper shall present in
                    detail how smart contracts work, what are the latest market trends regarding the invoice, and the
                    fundraiser (Initial Coin Offering – ICO) roadmap that will assist us in achieving our goals.
                </p>
                <h1 id="list-item-3"><span class="yellow-border">Co</span>ncept</h1>
                <p>Pcore blockchain (distributed ledger) technology applies smart contracts to assign a unique
                    fingerprint for every transaction. This makes it possible for businesses to automate their
                    invoicing processes and take advantage of factoring services on the platform. Serving as a medium,
                    Pcore ensures the safety of all parties’ funds while supplying the market space for business
                    conduction. Each account has a unique record, transparently shown for all participants. Thus,
                    through transparency, creditworthiness can be established through the blockchain platform. <br>
                    Pcore is an end-to-end platform that will provide SMEs easy access to short-term financing by
                    turning their accounts receivables into tradable assets. With a 24-hour turnaround available, the
                    interest rates allow lenders to earn profits while sellers gain vitally important liquidity for
                    their daily operations. <br>
                    The Pcore platform supports issuers, owners, and payers. Invoices can, therefore, be made available
                    as a shared source of liquidity for factoring. Uploading the income date, lenders would have the
                    option to choose the length of factoring and interest rate involved through smart contracts. Tokens
                    would connect parties from around the globe, disregarding borders in the process. <br>
                    However, only the firm itself or the recipient of the invoice can grant access to detailed
                    financial data about a specific company or invoice. This enables real-time auditing to be
                    conducted, improves the credit scoring process, and expedites credit approvals. Those companies
                    with a positive credit history will attract lenders with more ease while incentives and will be
                    available for use within their operations. The algorithm is based on companies XBRL data and risk
                    scoring results.

                </p>
                <h1 id="list-item-4"><span class="yellow-border">Th</span>e <b>Problem</b></h1>
                <p>We base our business on real-life issues that exist in various industries. Thus, the Pcore model
                    aims to solve obstacles that modern-day companies face when dealing with liquidity and financial
                    uncertainty. The main issues that plague numerous markets for some on regular bases are financial
                    constraints &factoring, invoice verification, as well as non-transparent/outdated financial
                    reports. <br>
                    <h5>4.1. Financial Constraints & Factoring</h5>
                    SMEs have limited access to short-term (working capital) financing. Banks demand significant
                    collateral and large amounts of documentation when approving financing projects, especially after
                    the latest recession in 2009. This represents a large funding gap for small and medium-sized
                    enterprises worldwide, fuelling the global factoring industry’s growth by 10% on yearly basis.
                    Current estimates suggest that invoice factoring market holds worth of US $3 trillion in 2018,
                    making it a quite a large market to delve into. <br>
                    Since the start of the financial crisis in 2009, factoring in the United States and the rest of the
                    world has been growing between a rate of 11% and 24% per annum, adding over one trillion euros in
                    annual factoring volume in less than a decade. The industry practically doubled its size, even
                    though the modern era of factoring began only a century ago. <br>
                    SMEs are at a clear disadvantage when dealing with a capital market in terms of credit rationing
                    and finance gaps, due to the lack of financial firepower. Gaps in financing have driven the need
                    for alternative sources of financing, such as invoice factoring.
                    <h5>4.2. Invoice Verification</h5>
                    There are several steps required when verifying the authenticity of the submitted invoice. These
                    include confirmation that invoiced services was actually delivered as claimed, inspection of
                    operations that have direct links with invoiced service, and investigation of materials used to
                    meet specified requirements upon which invoice was built. <br>
                    With the implementation of the ERP system, Pcore intends to automate all processes involved in
                    validity analysis, creating checkpoints for users to take when verifying genuinity of the potential
                    partners. History of submitted invoices that the company provided to the public enables further
                    automated assessment of validity and associated risk. <br>
                    In modern-day business, automated checks are virtually impossible without constant physical
                    inspection. Additionally, records can be forged, further limiting investors to uncover a foul play
                    when it is occurring. Since there is no real incentive for companies to reveal their live
                    financials to the public, there is a high probability of untruthful financial results.
                    <h5>4.3. Non-Transparent and Outdated Financial Reports</h5>
                    The issue with non-transparent financial reports is probably as old as business itself. There are
                    several reasons why companies wish to hide their true results, especially when invoicing is in
                    question. Business plans and financial reports, in general, should show financial health the
                    company has at the moment and in the past. However, by either omitting key data or even
                    manipulating their presentation, the firm in question would seem to be in a good position, whereas
                    its true situation is quite different. <br>
                    Although governments do enforce basic financial presentation guidelines through IFRS and GAAP
                    policies, many companies to find a way to bypass them nevertheless. The IFRS model represented a
                    step forward when it came to bribery and illicit activities investigation. However, it cannot
                    account for all possible venues where nontransparent reporting is in question, especially when SMEs
                    are involved. The need for invoice factoring rose in recent years, with businesses emerging within
                    the SME sector. However, the issues still remain regarding trust and accurate reporting.
                </p>
                <h1 id="list-item-5"><span class="yellow-border">Th</span>e Solution Part I: <b>Our Finincial Data
                        Format</b></h1>
                <p>As a presentation format of financial data within the platform, we opted for XBRL (eXtensible
                    Business Reporting Language). The framework represents an open international standard for digital
                    business reporting. It is used around the world, with companies from more than 50 countries
                    implementing it within their operations. Millions of XBRL documents are created every year,
                    replacing older, paper-based reports with useful, effective, and more accurate digital reports. <br>
                    In other words, XBRL provides a language in which reporting terms can be clearly defined. In turn,
                    terms can then be used to uniquely represent the contents of financial statements or other kinds of
                    compliance, performance, and business reports. XBRL is often called “bar codes for reporting”, as
                    it makes reporting more accurate and efficient. With unique tags, XBRL allows Pcore to develop its
                    platform according to sophisticated market needs, providing: <br>
                    • usable reporting documents that can automatically be registered, sorted and analyzed by Pcore <br>
                    • general trust that all reports within the platform follow up sophisticated, pre-defined
                    definitions <br>
                    Additionally, comprehensive definitions and accurate data tags would assist parties to conduct
                    various reporting tasks, including: <br>
                    • preparation <br>
                    • validation <br>
                    • publication <br>
                    • exchange <br>
                    • consumption <br>
                    • risk and performance analysis of business information. <br>
                    To enable the exchange of summary business reports, XBRL enforces transaction tags within the
                    platform. These transactional representations allow system-independent exchange and analysis of
                    large quantities of supporting data. Thus, as the key towards financial reporting transformation,
                    Pcore platform uses two core calculations to support investors in the evaluation of investment
                    opportunity. These two calculations include: <br>
                    1. Opportunity Qualification and Risk Assessment <br>
                    2. Predictive Behavior Credit Scoring with Artificial Intelligence <br>

                    <h5>5.1. Opportunity Qualification & Risk Assessment</h5>
                    As part of the XBRL system, we developed several functions that would act as triggers for business
                    decisions. These cover up opportunity identification & measurement, risk assessment, and
                    credit-scoring artificial intelligence (AI). It is important to mention that, although separate,
                    such software tools act as a part of a system, connected through a single platform – Pcore. <br>
                    <h5>5.1.1. Performance Analysis – Altman Z-score</h5>
                    In order to provide the lender with risk factoring information, the Altman Z-score calculation
                    formula has been implemented within the Pcore platform. As to properly evaluate corporate credit
                    risk, we implemented Altman Z-score Plus formula within our platform. <br>
                    The Altman Z-score is the output of a credit-strength test that gauges a publicly traded
                    manufacturing company's likelihood of bankruptcy. The Altman Z-score is based on five financial
                    ratios that can be calculated from data found on a company's annual 10K report. These include
                    profitability, leverage, liquidity, solvency, and activity ratios, to predict whether a company has
                    a high degree of insolvency probability. <br>
                    New York University Stern Finance Professor, Edward Altman, published the Altman Z-score formula in
                    1968. Years later, Altman released an updated version called the Altman Z-score Plus in 2012. The
                    newest version aimed to evaluate all types of companies, public and private, manufacturing and
                    nonmanufacturing, within, and outside of the US. <br>
                    The reason why we opted for Altman Z-score lies in the fact that its real-world application
                    produced results. In 2007, the credit ratings of specific asset-related securities had been rated
                    unrealistically high. The Altman Z-score indicated that the companies' risks were increasing
                    significantly, potentially heading towards bankruptcy. <br>
                    Altman calculated that the median Altman Z-score of companies in 2007 was 1.81, which was far below
                    than the A rating credit risk score. The result pointed out that businesses, at the time, were
                    highly distressed and had a significant bankruptcy probability. Soon after, the now widely-known
                    financial crisis occurred. <br>
                    Generally speaking, the lower the Z-Score, the higher risk of bankruptcy a company has, leading
                    investors to choose those with lower risk scores. However, different models have different overall
                    predictability scoring, depending on the industry in question. Nevertheless, scores of
                    Probabilities of 95% for one year and 70% within two years are sure signs of bankruptcy, no matter
                    the method or business sector. <br>
                    The Z-score represents a result of the following formula: <br>
                    𝑍 − 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 1.2𝑋!1 + 1.4𝑋!2 + 3.3𝑋!3 + 0.6𝑋!4 + 0.999𝑋!5 <br>
                    Where we have: <br>
                    𝑋!1 – Working capital / total assets <br>
                    𝑋!2 – Retained earnings / total assets <br>
                    𝑋!3 – Earnings before interests and taxes / total assets 𝑋! – Market value of equity / total
                    liabilities <br>
                    𝑋!4 – Sales / total assets <br>
                    <h5>5.1.2. Covering Invoice</h5>
                    The process of “covering” invoice at Pcore aims to bring forth ease of transactions and use, all
                    the while providing the necessary protection against fraudulent activities. Company/client can
                    upload invoice which they wish to secure, while Pcore covers 90% of the value. The “cover” carries
                    a fee, with the level of cost depending on the invoice’s credit score. Processing invoices are
                    possible only before the service is carried out. When applying, Pcore provides a quote based on the
                    score, listing out fees depending on the score level. <br>
                    The fee is expressed in Pcore token, as a main currency of the platform, while the transaction
                    itself has an option of customizable claim date, for payments with a delivery period ranging
                    between 60 or 90 days. Those invoices that have surpassed 60-days claim without receiving payment
                    would receive “cover payment” by Pcore team. <br>
                    The cover occurs within 24hours of the claim, expressed in exchangeable Pcore token. The digital
                    currency is exchangeable in any other fiat currency though external exchange platforms. Buyers
                    would settle the payment with the Pcore platform through the authorized “cover” invoice. To support
                    the process, the Pcore platform shall dedicate a team responsible for the invoice settlement. <br>
                    The fee program is listed below: <br>
                    - Pcore takes 10% of the seller’s invoice and charges 20% for the service. <br>
                    - Pcore takes 10% of the buyer’s (debt) invoice and charges 20% for the service. <br>
                    As for the risk management, below is the “cover” score schedule, depending on the “health” of the
                    invoice and company behind it. Level “1” stands for highest score (least risky) and “5” as lowest
                    (very risky): <br>
                    1 - 10% <br>
                    2 - 15% <br>
                    3 - 20% <br>
                    4 - 25% <br>
                    5 - 30% <br>
                    In practical terms, should system indicate that invoice in question should receive level 1, Pcore
                    insures 90% of the value. Should the transaction fail for any reason, the buyer earns back 90% of
                    the original investment, while Pcore would seek to retrieve the funds back from the seller. <br>
                    However, we also provide an option for uninsured invoices. In this particular case, the buyer takes
                    all of the responsibility for the transaction, including losses from invoice default. <br>
                    Buyers/investors also have the option to contact Pcore experts for legal help, should sellers
                    default on their agreed-upon payments that do not have status “covered”. <br>
                    Additionally, the Pcore platform also offers the ability to purchase a part of the invoice, if the
                    seller finds such function agreeable. The size can vary while status “covered” is obligatory for
                    such transactions to take place. The interest payments are sized according to the purchased share.
                    <h5>5.1.2.1 Securing the Invoice – From Seller’s Perspective</h5>
                    Sellers, after registering an account, should provide documents necessary for the verification
                    process. After the Pcore teams review the application, sellers thus have the ability to upload
                    invoice(s) into the auction marketplace. It is possible to upload both documents and invoice
                    offering at the same time. However, for the offer to be available, verification of the company is
                    necessary. <br>
                    Once uploaded, sellers have the option of insuring or not insuring their invoices and shall be
                    visible for investors as well. The risk score (1 to 5) is assigned, dedicating the percentage
                    listed in the previous section, notifying the seller of the assigned score once the “cover” process
                    is complete. <br>
                    The “cover” offers sellers an additional pathway should their operations fail to catch up with
                    financial obligations. It adds considerable time for the selling company to gain necessary
                    resources and pay the amount back to Pcore. Such occurrence shall not be known to the buyer, as to
                    protect the seller’s reputation from the start. However, fees included for the delayed payment are:
                    <br>
                    - “Cover” score fee (10% to 30%) <br>
                    - Commission: 2% <br>
                    - Late Payment Fee: (10% to 30%) <br>
                    As an example, for an invoice of $10,000 with cover 90% (risk score 1 – 10%), the seller would have
                    to pay $1,000 cover fee as invoice score 1 risk, and $200 as commission fee, totaling for $1200
                    that Pcore would collect. Late payment fee will only effect receipt. Receipt. <br>
                    In the case of diligent payment, the commission fee for seller’s invoice transactions stands at 2%.
                    <h5>5.1.2.2 Facilitating Invoice Payments Through Own Software Development</h5>
                    As part of our future development plans, we intend on developing own invoice processing software.
                    Namely, the system would provide services for clients in terms of customized & professional invoice
                    templates, quick invoice creation, email reminders, bulk transactions, and information sharing
                    centers. Through the blockchain network, we plan to implement the software through our ledger
                    records, as to increase the security of the marketplace. <br>
                    Additionally, reminders and invoiced processing would facilitate Pcore token while software would
                    act as a monitoring service for companies that manage multiple invoice partnerships. We also plan
                    to implement mobile platforms for iOS and Android users, as to increase accessibility of the
                    platform. <br>
                    Lastly, the software would provide options regarding billable expenses, whereas sellers and buyers
                    could attach receipts/bills on invoice deals. The software itself would be developed after the
                    launch of the platform, as to facilitate the growth of the market. Thus, Pcore teams would gain
                    access to a large set of data, aiding it in the end design of the software, taking into account
                    real trends within the Pcore platform. <br>
                    <h5>5.1.3. Pcore Own Risk Assessment</h5>
                    As a service provider, Pcore has a moral and legal obligation to keep all investments safe,
                    building an environment that promotes profitable partnerships. Thus, we keep 1 million coins to be
                    distributed from our yearly profits/retained earnings. <br>
                    Thus, the Altman score and our own scrutinization of the platform’s market will ensure that only
                    invoices from legitimate businesses are available. In addition to our investigations, we shall keep
                    tabs on existing deals. Thus, if issues occur with defaulting invoice projects, we strive to reach
                    our clients and help them find suitable solutions. <br>
                    As part of our privacy policy, all business conduction, documents, communication, as well as other
                    sensitive information remains private. We do not intend and will not allow sharing such information
                    with a 3rd party. We take the privacy of our clients very seriously since the inner working of
                    business is a competitive advantage. If exposed, it can lead to significant damages, our reputation
                    included. <br>
                    We help to identify fake invoices by tracking down documentation. Should a situation occur that
                    said files have been forged or compromised, we intend to help businesses recover their lost funds.
                    Lastly, to protect sensitive data, the Pcore platform deletes all business documents and private
                    information from the system regarding the specific transaction. Should parties agree to retrieve
                    such data, we are willing to reverse the order and keep documents safe for later use. Invoice
                    owners will only hold login and username detail, as an additional measure of personal data
                    protection. <br>
                    <h5>5.2. AI Predictive Behavioral Credit Scoring</h5>
                    As part of our blockchain platform, we saw a need to implement AI predictive scoring protocols,
                    that would allow us to generate a vast amount of data as the client base grows. <br>
                    The AI scoring constitutes processes that gather information about the user’s background (documents
                    submitted, financial health, history of business conduction, and history of invoice offers),
                    current invoice offerings, general score gained by Altman Z-score and, if applicable, “cover” score
                    levels as well. <br>
                    <img src="assets/images/solution1.png" alt="1">
                    <br>
                    The tool measures up sources of primary and alternative data, using advanced machine learning in
                    order to predict a borrower’s creditworthiness. It also allows the Pcore team to prioritize
                    verified users with high scoring rates and low-risk levels to shine through while pinpointing those
                    accounts that may carry a large amount of risks. <br>
                    The software stands as a compliment tool for enhanced Hive Risk Assessment program, represented in
                    the separate section of this whitepaper.

                <p>For the purpose of the general financial health check, our income statement relies heavily on the
                    user base. Due to the novelty of the idea, we expect that the number of clients will grow steadily
                    in the future, which is reflected in our financial report. Detailed income statement can be found
                    in Appendix A while user-base growth table on Appendix B. <br>
                    Our financial model relies on several streams of revenues, upon which we have built our
                    expectations. Namely, we evaluated invoices from sellers at £5,000. We take into account that 20
                    out of 100 users would opt for “cover” services, out of which 20 users that have taken cover 5
                    would not meet payments due date. Thus, we have 20% revenues obtained through commissions and fees
                    related to “cover” transactions. <br>
                    Additionally, as we expect year 1 to be the period of investment, there are important milestones
                    and facts that we need to address. These include: <br>
                    Technology year 1 includes construction of UK-based site, while year 2 consists of updating the UK
                    platform and construction of Chinese online platform <br>
                    The Pcore cover payout is for invoices that have been covering by the score. The seller cannot
                    retrieve payment in time reasoning in payout to investors <br>
                    Commission 2% for using invoice selling platform <br>
                    Pcore cover where seller chooses to use invoice cover. Charge percentage depends on the overall
                    invoice value <br>
                    Pcore cover payout return is for invoices that have opted for cover and invoice seller returns
                    Pcore Interested 8% represents interest gained from overdue invoice cover payment <br>
                    Monthly Fee charge is reserved only for the Chinese platform, with a launch planned on the 4th
                    month of year 2 <br>
                    We expect sharp incline of net income at the end of the second year of operations, with both UK and
                    China markets contributing to growth. The overall income surge we expect stands at 368%, driven by
                    the increased number of clients and P2P transactions. Furthermore, we expect a yearly increase in
                    net income between 500% and 1,000% by the end of year 6, when compared to year 2. <br>
                    Whereas fixed costs remain stable, due to the increased number of clients, variable costs, Cover
                    Payout expenses especially, will grow proportionately. Thus, it is no wonder that variable costs
                    will overgrow fixed expenses by the end of the second year. <br>
                    <br>
                    However, we do have cost efficiency plans to contain the cost per user, in order to bring forth
                    income as promised. Thus, we plan to implement heavy scrutinization management systems that would
                    allow us to keep “cover” expenses at the required level, with a minimum amount of defaults and bad
                    debt as possible. <br>
                    On the side of revenues, the main income drive remains to be “Cover” score revenues, constituting
                    almost 64% of our entire revenue figures for both years. The said income channel is heavily reliant
                    on the user base, which we expect to grow substantially, especially after the penetration of the
                    Chinese market. <br>
                    ON the side of users, as we increase our marketing expenditure and further penetrate the UK an
                    Chinese markets, we expect sharp incline of newly registered accounts. Thus, the expected growth
                    rate for year 2 stands at 604%, mainly due to the opening of the Chinese market. <br>
                    <br>
                    We took into consideration that, although China’s marketplace would be larger, the overall revenue
                    power of Chinese clients is lower. Thus, our model takes into consideration lower revenues, even
                    though a larger number of users would come from China. <br>
                    <br>
                    Lastly, funds will be used for 50% buyback of Pcore coin, which will be burned upon the purchase,
                    to keep the market flowing seamlessly. We shall repeat the process until the entire market holds 1M
                    Pcore PCC coin in circulation. Thus, we plan to achieve 1 million token markets by between years 4
                    and 5. <br>

                <p>With Brexit heavily in minds of UK citizens and business alike, we strived to conduct an accurate
                    analysis of the situation. As it turns out, for invoice factoring, we see Brexit HYPERLINK
                    "https://www.theweek.co.uk/brexit-0" HYPERLINK "https://www.theweek.co.uk/brexit-0" HYPERLINK
                    "https://www.theweek.co.uk/brexit-0" as a chance and not as an obstacle at this moment. The
                    economic power of the United Kingdom should not be underestimated, while Brexit opens the door of
                    non-EU countries to sign trade deals. <br>
                    Thus, our second largest market, after the UK, would be China. The Pcore limited expansion team
                    will look to establish a worthy partnership across the Asian country, which is seen as the fastest
                    growing economy in the world. The number of large businesses in various industries speaks that the
                    country is a good source of revenues, especially since overseas invoice factoring might be quite
                    attractive for expanding Chinese investors. <br>
                    Currently, China has a labor force of more than 800 million, while exports account for $2.5
                    trillion, mainly to Europe and the US despite the trading war going on. With Apple leading the
                    example, most of the largest companies in the world are of Chinese background or have large
                    production units in the country. Thus, many of the smaller and medium-sized service companies exist
                    that support enterprises and large population. <br>
                    The real value that our platform can provide for Chinese companies lies in the fact that the
                    Chinese market is in the expansion. Companies coming from the Asian market will have the
                    opportunity to reach for invoices outside of their borders, using domestic currency to obtain Pcore
                    coins. Without investments into marketing, investigation of new markets, and other expenses, both
                    Chinese and European companies stand to gain from the P2P invoice factoring, excluding large
                    investments to do so. <br>
                    Additionally, China’s companies will be able to benefit from the know-how that the Pcore team shall
                    provide, in terms of data validation, profit analysis, and security measures. Pcore we charge a
                    monthly fee for invoice sellers with a 2% commission on platform sold invoices. <br>
                    Main benefits of including China as our target market expansion plans consist of: <br>
                    1) China firm will be able to send manufactured products after providing details to credible
                    Europe/U.K. clients <br>
                    2) Chinese companies will be able to forward invoices after the delivery of services/goods to Pcore
                    auction platform and free up funds at a discount price <br>
                    3) Help connect China and U.K./Europe trading partners. New trading partners from Europe U.K. will
                    be able to receive good/products without upfront payments. Thus, the platform will help to build
                    trust and enable both parties to flourish

                <h1 id="list-item-8"><span class="yellow-border">Th</span>e Solution Part II: <b>Blockchain Technology</b></h1>
                <p>Since our platform completely relies on the blockchain technology, it is important to mention its
                    features that we wish to implement within the Pcore invoice platform. These include smart contracts
                    & public ledger, and smart oracles. <br>
                    <h5>8.1. Smart Contracts</h5>
                    One of the main weapons that blockchain technology has to offer is smart contracts. These are
                    cryptographic protocols that make up the transactional process. They verify, maintain and release
                    funds between two or more parties, using negotiation as the basis of security. Thus, each smart
                    contract has a list of predetermined requirements that need to be satisfied in order or smart
                    contract to take place. <br>
                    <img src="assets/images/solution2-1.png" alt="2">
                    <br>
                    In the case of Pcore, we implemented the Ethereum’s technological tool by imbuing invoice and
                    verification requirements into the contract. Additionally, the system takes into consideration the
                    deal upon which buyers and sellers agreed upon, including invoice’s value, date of expiry, interest
                    rate, “cover” features, and other functions. Once all of these prerequisites are satisfied, only
                    then will smart contract release funds. <br>
                    Each transaction is carried out through smart contracts, including deposits and withdrawals,
                    securing the market place against fraudulent offers but hackers as well. <br>
                    <h5>8.2. Smart Oracles</h5>
                    Although smart contracts are really useful in terms of inner-blockchain transactions, for external
                    exchange services and evaluation of cryptocurrencies, smart oracles are needed. The protocol came
                    in as a novelty in the blockchain world, as it allows users to verify real-world events, much like
                    smart contracts with its prerequisites. However, it also takes into account the transitions within
                    the platform, as it supplies smart contrast with necessary data. <br>
                    <img src="assets/images/solution2-2.png" alt="3">
                    <br>
                    At Pcore, we use smart oracles by combining the company’s information, financial status and include
                    market trends, such as USD to the GBP exchange rate. We also take into other fiat currencies, as
                    well as banking information if available, to constitute our risk management and score checks.

                <h1 id="list-item-9"><span class="yellow-border">Hi</span>ve <b>Ecosystem & Processes</b></h1>
                <p>In order to accommodate the growing number of users and thus, documents, we implemented the Hive
                    ecosystem within our Pcore platform. The blockchain-based solutions atomize the verification of
                    identity and legitimacy of submitted documents, without the interference of the centralized system.
                    Within the Pcore site, Hive system would navigate through documents submitted of the business, the
                    username, passwords, as well as invoice facts and data. <br>
                    The Hive architecture uses Personally Identifiable Information (PII) protocols that recognize
                    off-ledger data, including terms, numbers, and even images. This will allow the Pcore platform to
                    keep data secured through Hive Vendors, as it also implements preset rules on information sharing.
                    AS reputation is important, the Hive architecture also takes into consideration “cover” scores, as
                    well as fee programs associated with each individual invoice and user. The Customer Due Diligence
                    process contains a set of requirements that each client, buyer, and seller alike, should contain.
                    Thus, we intend to atomize our verification process through the implementation of Hive ecosystem.

                <p>Taking into account business development, we planned out an Initial coin Offering (ICO) as a channel
                    of funding to build the necessary infrastructure for the Pcore invoice factoring platform. Using
                    blockchain technology, we aim to build complete service and support teams that would carry out the
                    necessary tasks of constructing, maintaining, and supporting the online marketplace. <br>
                    The funds gained through the ICO would allow us to fund necessary operational activities, such as
                    company offices, develop the trading platform, higher domestic and foreign professionals. At the
                    starting stage, the only available currency shall be Pcore token, used for payments, fees,
                    withdrawals, and deposits. <br>
                    Should ICO commence successfully, the infrastructure would be developed within 2019, setting off
                    the platform in a timely manner. Additionally, part of the pre-mined Pcore coins will serve as a
                    reserve and bounty, while another portion will be held by the management team to ensure scaling
                    opportunities. <br>
                    As the market grows, we intend to list the token in external exchanges, to increase possible
                    options for clients from around the globe. Thus, as a final stage, we intend to make core token
                    tradable with any fiat currency in the world and attract top-notch companies to trade invoices
                    within our platform. <br>
                    Below is the planned supply of Pcore tokens: <br>
